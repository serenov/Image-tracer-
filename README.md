# Image-tracer
A simple game for manually tracing the coordinates of a specific shape in an image, with a niche application such as Fourier analysis. It can be used to evaluate the coefficients in Fourier series.<br/>

## ABOUT THE GAME
The game has a 9 x 9 magnified frame view of the image, the pixels in the image with solid fill (i.e, alpha 255) assigned black color and the rest assigned white.

## CONTROLS
Control keys move the logger block (it logs the coordinates it is in after a key press).<br/><br/>
